Hello! To run the application please

- run client by going to client folder and run `yarn` and `yarn start`
- run server by going to server folder and run `./gradlew bootRun` (for Java11)

I am sorry for lack of docker! :)

I can see of course a lot of place for improvements, but I used so much time figuring out how to write API in Java, that I think I am done with the project, we can discuss details later, if you wish

- mayor improvement - SSE from server when new data appear instead of polling from client
